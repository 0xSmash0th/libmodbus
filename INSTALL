Basic Installation
==================

Autotools
--------

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.


Waf
---

$ waf configure
$ waf build
$ sudo waf install
