Basic Installation
==================

With autotools
--------------

The shell commands are './configure; make; make install'.


With Waf
--------

The build system is Waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf), the shell commandes are
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build
$ sudo ./waf install

or 'waf' if you use a global Waf script.

The sources are built in the 'build' directory at the root of the
project source files.


WARNING, don't use the two build systems at the same time.
