Basic Installation
==================

The build system is Waf, the shell commandes are
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build
$ sudo ./waf install

The sources are built in the 'build' directory at the root of the
project source files.

The compilation with autotools is DEPRECATED. The shell commands were
'./configure; make; make install'. Warning, don't use the two build systems at
the same time.
