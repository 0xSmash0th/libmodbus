Basic Installation
==================

The build system is Waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf), the shell commandes are
$ waf configure
$ waf build
$ sudo waf install

or ./waf if you use a local Waf script.

The sources are built in the 'build' directory at the root of the
project source files.

The compilation with autotools is DEPRECATED. The shell commands were
'./configure; make; make install'. Warning, don't use the two build systems at
the same time.
